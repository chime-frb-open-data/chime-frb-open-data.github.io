This `importance` value is a machine learning score generated by a classifier that is trained to distinguish two classes using the real-time meta data available at the L2-L3 stage.

The output of the classifier during operation is then scaled as a gradient across the decision boundary between these two classes, allowing for a real-valued score between 0 and 10. The training data is prepared by a combination of (1) human labelling and (2) automated labelling (followed up with human correction) using the previous release of the classifier. Finally, the score reported in the VOEvent is scaled down to [0, 1] from [0, 10].\n",
